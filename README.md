# Password Generator Starter Code
For this week's weekly challange we were asked to use javascript to update an existing HTML to perform a password generator. 
First I started to analyze the prompt and started pulling up my ideas together. 
Before I started the challange I wrote down ideas on how to perform correctly the code. 
First I started by naming the Variables at the top of the page 
and then creating several functions, each with the purpose of generating the password at the end 
one to determine the length of the password, another one to determine if there will be numbers, another one for special characters and finally the main function to generate the password 
After several days and many hours I was finally able to generate the password. The most challanging part was traducing pseudo code into actual coding terminology.
